To express his gratitude for the boatman who saved him and to honor the newly crowned King George I, he created this race. It was open to young watermen who had recently completed their apprenticeships, giving them a chance to demonstrate their rowing skills. Over time, this event became not just a tribute to a personal event, but a long-standing tradition that celebrates both history and the craft of rowing on the Thames.",

These effects were later discovered to be caused by a virus affecting the flower, but at the time they were considered extremely rare and beautiful. Breeders carefully cultivated new hybrids, and collectors paid large sums for bulbs with unusual appearances. This diversity in types helped fuel the tulip craze, as people competed to own the most exotic specimens.",

          text: "The tulip trade operated on a complex system of contracts, options, and informal agreements. Because bulbs bloom only once a year, buyers often agreed on future purchases, sometimes without even seeing the flower. Specialized markets were established where traders could buy and sell tulip futures. Prices were agreed upon months in advance, and payments were made when the bulbs were delivered. This abstract trading model made it easier for speculators to participate, but it also disconnected the trade from the real value of the product itself.",

          text: "Tulip trading wasn’t limited to the Netherlands. As demand grew, bulbs were shipped across Europe—from France to England and beyond. Traders carried these rare goods by land and sea, navigating a web of routes and tariffs. Each region had its own preferences, and what was fashionable in Amsterdam might not be as popular in Paris. Nonetheless, tulips remained a desirable item among European elites, and international trade routes helped spread both the flower and its financial influence across the continent.",

          text: "The tulip market collapsed suddenly in 1637. After years of increasing prices and wild speculation, confidence disappeared overnight. Buyers stopped showing up to auctions, and contracts became worthless. Panic spread, and traders who had invested heavily were left with massive debts and unsellable bulbs. This event, often referred to as the first economic bubble in history, highlighted the dangers of speculative markets. The tulip crash left a deep impact on the Dutch economy and became a cautionary tale still taught in economics courses today.",

The term zoological garden refers to zoology, the study of animals. The abbreviation zoo was first used of the London Zoological Gardens, which was opened for scientific study in 1828, and to the public in 1847. In the early days, the zoo was opened to serve the wealthy and high-status people in society.",

          text: "Later, it was realized that humans were curious about strange things. Large predators such as lions, bears or rare animals often caused great interest and could attract many people to see them. For that reason, some zoos opened their doors and welcomed all the people. It is noteworthy that in addition to animals, some zoos also displayed humans. Humans were occasionally displayed in cages at zoos along with non-human animals, to illustrate the differences between people of European and non-European origin. This attracted even more attention from the public - people who saw animals or people who were completely unfamiliar to them for the first time.",

          text: "In the early days, the sole purpose of zoos was entertainment. People simply went to zoos to see things that interested them or that they thought were strange. As time went on, people’s need for information increased. People always asked questions about the things they saw in zoos, such as where they came from, what their previous habitats were, how they reproduced, etc. This led the zookeepers to decide to add that knowledge to the cages in zoos.",

          text: "In large animals, a limited number of spaces were available in zoos. As a consequence, in the early days, these animals were kept in cramped cages where they could only survive. This greatly reduced the life expectancy of animals in zoos. Later, the government and zoo managers decided to expand the area where the animals were kept. This was also a humane move. In some places, people even arranged the environment to be closer to the wild environment so that the animals could have more space to move. This change in living space improved the quality of life of many animals. Many of them began to reproduce in the zoo's captive environment.",
